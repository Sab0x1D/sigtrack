**IOC & Signature Tracker**  
A curated repository for mapping and organizing threat detection signatures and indicators.

---

## Purpose

- **YARA Rules** â€” Context mapping, rule-to-IOC alignment, and signature families  
- **Sigma Rules** â€” SIEM-based behavioral detection  
- **IOC Mapping** â€” IPs, hashes, C2s, mutexes, registry paths, and more  
- **Cross-linked** with [ghostyara](https://github.com/Sab0x1D/ghostyara) rules

Organized for red/blue/purple teams, SOC automation, CTI workflows, and malware tracebacks.
